# STM32H745 Inter Processor/Core Communication Measurement Repository

The visualization repository is available here: [stm32h745-ipc-visu](https://github.com/kovacsdotgergo/stm32h745-ipc).

The goal of the project to measure the overhead of the IPC communication on a multicore microcontroller running FreeRTOS. The project uses FreeRTOS on both microcontroller cores, and utilizes the Message Buffer for IPC.

This project can be used with STMCubeIDE. The measurement can be controlled by a script in the visualization repository via serial port.

The state of the code at the time of the TDK submission is tagged.
